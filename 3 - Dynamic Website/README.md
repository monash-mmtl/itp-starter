## Quick Start (Recommended)

Before running the setup script, complete these steps:

1. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:**
   ```sh
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

   ```sh
   # To set up all dependencies (backend & frontend)
   ./setup.sh

   # To start both backend and frontend servers
