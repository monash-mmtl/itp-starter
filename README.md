# ITP Starter Kits

This repository contains several starter folders for different types of web and AI projects. Below is an explanation of each folder and how to get started:

## 1 - LLMs and Gradio
- **Purpose:** Deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) with a Gradio web interface.
- **Recommended for:** AI projects and rapid prototyping. Use this if you'd just like to play around with AI and prompt engineering for your use case!
- **How to start:**
  - Navigate to this folder.
  - Run `main.py` to launch the Gradio website.

## 2 - LLMs only
- **Purpose:** Use of LLMs without a pre-built UI.
- **Recommended for:** Advanced students who want to build their own user interface around an AI base.
- **Note:** Cannot be started as-is; requires further development to add a UI or other interaction method.

## 3 - Dynamic Website
- **Purpose:** Example of a dynamic, full-stack website.
- **Recommended for:** Students seeking a challenge and experience with both frontend and backend development.
- **How to start:**
  - Run `./setup.sh` to install dependencies.
  - Run `./start.sh` to start the project.

## 4 - Static Website
- **Purpose:** Simple static website that can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Recommended for:** Students who want to quickly deploy a static website (i.e. no AI).
- **How to check the site:**
  - Open `4 - Static Website/index.html` in your browser.
- **Tip:** Search for "GitHub Pages deployment" on Google if you want to publish this site online.
